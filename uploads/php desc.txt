PHP, which stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a server-side scripting language extensively used in web development. Introduced by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP is designed to create dynamic and interactive web applications. As a server-side language, PHP code is executed on the server, generating HTML that is then sent to the client's browser. Its seamless integration with HTML allows developers to embed PHP code within HTML tags.

Variables in PHP are declared with the `$` symbol, and PHP is loosely typed, meaning variables' data types are determined by their content. Control structures like if statements, loops, and switch cases provide means for logical decision-making and repetitive tasks. Functions allow developers to encapsulate code into reusable blocks.

PHP supports arrays, both indexed and associative, offering flexibility in storing multiple values. For database interaction, PHP connects to databases like MySQL, enabling the execution of queries. Session management and cookie handling support user authentication and personalization.

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a significant feature of PHP, allowing the creation of classes and objects. PHP frameworks, such as Laravel and Symfony, simplify web development tasks. Security features include input validation, data sanitization, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

With a robust community and extensive documentation, PHP remains a popular choice for web development. Its versatility, ease of use, and continuous updates contribute to its widespread adoption. Always refer to the official PHP documentation for the latest information and best practices.
